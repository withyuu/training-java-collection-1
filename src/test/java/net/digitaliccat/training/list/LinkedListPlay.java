 * LinkedList and ArrayList share the same interface of List.
 * Most of their operations are the same. The only different is the time and memory complexity for each operation.
 * With the time limit for this course and since it is a good practice for a software engineer to try things and
 * make his/her hand dirty, I suggest you create a "Play" suite for LinkedList here yourself.
 *
 * Have fun!
